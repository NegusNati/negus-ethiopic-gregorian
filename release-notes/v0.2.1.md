# v0.2.1 (2025-09-22)

## Highlights
- Added `llm.txt` and `llm.md`, detailed reference guides for large-language-model integrations that walk through every export, type, and workflow in the package.
- Clarified README messaging around the dedicated highlights entry and installation footprint.
- New `release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow verifies tag builds, publishes to npm and GitHub Packages, and auto-creates GitHub releases with bundled tarballs and release notes.

## Docs
- CHANGELOG now tracks the documentation additions for 0.2.1.
- Release notes refreshed to point consumers to the new LLM resources.

## Verification
- `npm run build`
- `npm_config_cache=.tmp-npm-cache npm pack --dry-run --json`
- `vitest run`
- Set `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret before tagging to enable npm publication; GitHub Packages uses the provided `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
