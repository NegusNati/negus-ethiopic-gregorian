# v0.2.2 (2025-09-22)

## Highlights
- Added **Ethiopian National Flag Day** - a dynamic highlight that intelligently calculates the first Monday of Tikimt (Ethiopian month 2) for any year, typically falling in October.
- Updated "International Labour Day" to **"International Labor Day"** (standardized American spelling) while preserving the existing functionality and Amharic translation.
- Enhanced the dynamic highlight calculation system with robust year overlap handling for Ethiopian calendar-based holidays.

## New Features
- **Ethiopian National Flag Day** (`የኢትዮጵያ ብሔራዊ ሰንደቅ ዓላማ ቀን`) - automatically calculates the correct date each year:
  - 2024: October 14 (Monday)
  - 2025: October 13 (Monday)
  - Categorized as 'national' with tags: `['ethiopia', 'flag', 'national-day']`
- Improved dynamic rule handling with error resilience for edge cases

## Technical Details
- Implemented `ethiopianFlagDayGregorian()` function that converts Ethiopian calendar calculations to Gregorian dates
- Enhanced the dynamic highlights array in `rules.ts` with the new flag day rule
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing highlight APIs

## Verification
- `npm run build`
- Dynamic highlight calculation tested for years 2024-2025
- Search functionality verified: `searchHighlights('flag')` and `searchHighlights('Ethiopian National')` both return the new highlight
- All existing tests continue to pass
