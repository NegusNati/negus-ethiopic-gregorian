# v0.2.4 (2025-10-06)

## Highlights
- **Irreechaa festival coverage** - Added Hora Finfinne (Saturday) and Hora Harsede (Sunday) observances as dynamic highlights, aligning with the festival's first-weekend-of-October tradition.
- **Cross-calendar support** - Dynamic rules now project Irreechaa into both Gregorian (first Saturday/Sunday in October) and Ethiopic (Meskerem 24-25 or equivalent) calendars.
- **Search & utilities update** - Highlight helpers recognise Oromo queries ("Irreechaa") and surface the new observances across day/month/year lookups.

## Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Updated highlights table and notes with Irreechaa context and scheduling details.
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Recorded the new feature and linked comparison for v0.2.4.

## Testing & Verification
- `npm run test`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`

## Notes
Irreechaa celebrations shift slightly when Meskerem straddles Gregorian leap years. The dynamic rule derives the first Saturday/Sunday of October to stay aligned with observed ceremonies at Hora Finfinne (Addis Ababa) and Hora Harsede (Bishoftu).
